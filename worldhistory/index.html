              <h3>ABOUT THIS PILOT</h3>
<p>This World History course offers students grade 10-12 a unique learning opportunity to discover world history. It is a digital tutoring course (think half Montesorri and half MOOC) taken entirely in a computer lab on custom learning software. By the end of the course in May, students should have enough knowledge of World History for them to do well on the AP WH test. </p>

<p>The course officially starts January 8th, though we might accept latecomers. We will ask our students to show up at our Boston computer lab two times/week for 1.5 hours sessions on Monday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Our learning software and methodology are still experimental, so students may be asked to provide us feedback about the model. </p>

<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
<p>LAN Academy Inc is a nonprofit start-up based out of Northeastern University and dedicated to providing world-class alternative education to students around the world, whether that's India, Micronesia, or right here in Boston.</p>

<h3>GOALS OF THIS COURSE</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>To engage student's interests and provide them a fascinating World History course</li>
<li>To prepare students to take and receive college credit from the AP World History test</li>
<li>To validate our personal learning paths as potential routes for more students to follow</li>
<li>To learn from our students how to improve our platform and content</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>DETAILS & BENEFITS</h3>
<p>Many of us on "Team LAN" are total history nerds, so we designed this course to be taught the way we wished history was taught- with broad overviews over common themes across history combined with many opportunities to go in depth on the topics that most interested us. As students work through the course, they have many opportunities to further explore and take notes on key concepts, figures, and events through integrated wikipedia and other resources. </p>
<p>Students who go all the way through the course will have their $90 AP test fee entirely covered by LAN Academy.</p>

			<h3>Permission and Liability Form</h3>
			<p>All students under 18 must bring the following form signed and initialized by a parent. Available <a href="./LANPermissionandLiabilityWaiver.pdf">here (pdf)</a>.</p>
