Past things that we’ve done and our future plans:

 

LAN Academy started off as a partnership with African Indian Alliance to explore further uses of their computer lab. We are currently set up in two of their computer labs serving approximately seventy students. On our second trip to India, LAN Academy updated those labs with LAN Academy Version 1.5, and added a new lab in the Jesuit-run High School in Mundgod. In August of 2012 LAN Academy sent a prototype lab with volunteers to Micronesia as part of our efforts to pilot new methods of distribution.

 

For 2014, we hope to further expand our partnership – both in distribution and development of LAN Academy. We also plan on piloting a number of programs including a local office and computer lab in Guyana, as well as an AP class in Boston.
