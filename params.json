{"name":"About LAN Academy","tagline":"","body":"\r\n![](http://media.tumblr.com/d8e20f0fd17052e6d4365d50a41be8c9/tumblr_inline_mouabhYTLC1qawmfj.png)\r\n\r\n## What we do:\r\n\r\nLAN Academy is a nonprofit committed to bringing high-quality education around the world through simple, cheap, and offline learning labs. These learning labs are established through partnerships between LAN Academy and locally-active non-profits. Local partners provide a physical space, guidance, and mentorship to students. LAN Academy provides our \"Magic Box\": a small offline server filled with the best educational content the world has to offer.\r\n\r\nOur Learning Labs bring the digital learning revolution to ones who need it the most - the 4.5 billion people in the world without internet access.\r\n\r\n## Our Vision\r\n\r\n> ## **“Access to education is a crucial precondition to educational impact, but what matters most thereafter is the quality of education.” _- USAID strategy (February 2011)_**\r\n\r\nWe believe high-quality education is the best way to bring people out of poverty and that it is possible to do this on a global scale  by making the online abundance of quality educational materials accessible to underprivileged students through a worldwide network of partners who care about their local communities.\r\n\r\nAt our heart, we embrace exploratory learning - the idea that it is possible for learning to feel natural and unforced by allowing students take control of their own learning. We believe that knowledge is rich and multidimensional and that different students learn in very different ways. The curiosity and unique interests of each student are what make our Learning Labs such a powerful education system.\r\n\r\n## Why LAN Academy?\r\n\r\nQuality education is critical to realizing human potential, but schools in poverty-stricken regions are often ill-equipped, overcrowded, and unable to teach students beyond a basic level. NGOs working in these communities understand the need, but current education investment options are either costly or otherwise not ideal. New education technology such as MOOCs have potential, but most students who need educational intervention lack reliable internet access.\r\n\r\nLAN Academy is built for exactly these situations. Partner NGOs provide the physical space and lab supervision. We provide a fundraising campaign to cover the hardware costs. Our products and Learning Lab model allow the neediest students access to some of the best educators in the world.\r\n\r\n## Our Impact\r\n\r\nIs this really an effective system? How do you know you are making an impact?\r\n\r\nImpact measurement is a concern for every socially-minded venture, especially for ones as ambitious as we are. We work continuously to perfect our education model, but from the very beginning we have based our efforts off the works of cutting edge education researchers such as TED Fellow Sugata Mitra, whose work can be seen [this article](http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/docs/Paper13.pdf) he published in 2010 and in this  [outline](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk60sYrU2RU&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=399s) of his research.\r\n\r\nOur Learning Labs build off this research and are our attempt to answer the question: “But what about the students who do not have reliable internet access?” We think we are on the right track.\r\n\r\nAs we expand, we will be constantly performing our own openly-available research on exactly how effective our specific setup is across countries and cultures.\r\n\r\n## Current Partners:\r\n\r\nIn 2012, we partnered with **African Indian Alliance** to install two labs in Karnataka, India. Field reports indicate that the current labs are popular and having an impact. We are in the midst of returning Summer 2013 to gather data, update labs, and install two additional labs in nearby villages.\r\n\r\nVisit the [Collaborate With Us](lanacademy.org/collaborate) page to learn more and to express interest in becoming a new partner.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"one_half last\">\r\n\r\n## Team\r\n\r\n**Full-Time:**\r\n\r\nJohn Williams (CEO) is the vision behind LAN Academy.
